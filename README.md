# Data Science for Social Good Tutorials

## Ethics Workshop

## Stakeholder Workshop


## Git and Git Workflow Tutorial
### Jake Vanderplas
- This tutorial will involve mostly hands-on practice, working on single-user git workflow, branching and merging, collaboration using git at the command-line, and collaboration using github features such as Issues and Pull Requests.


## AWS Tutorial
### Amanda Tan and Rob Fatland
- Participants will learn to provision compute resources, use the AWS command line tools, and build a lightweight system to encourage collaboration and data sharing.

## Software Design Tutorial 
### Joe Hellerstein
- By the end of this tutorial you will be able to: 1)define the terms use case, component description, and component interactions 2) construct use cases for a simple problem 3) construct a component description and interactions for a simple problem

## Object Oriented Python
### Joe Hellerstein
- By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to: 1) define a new python class 2) implement instance methods that use instance variables 3) use class inheritance as a way to structure code and articulate the value of doing so 4) describe two widely used diagrams for object oriented design - class diagrams and interaction diagrams

## Introduction to SQL and Geospatial Data Processing
### Valentina Staneva and Anthony Arendt
The goals of this workshop are: 1) to introduce the notion of a database and the advantages of using it 2) to get acquainted with the SQL syntax and learn how to extract interesting information from big datasets and 3) to understand the challenges of working with geospatial data and learn how to perform geospatial queries with SQL

## Reproducibility Workshop
### Valentina Staneva and Meg Drouhard
- In the DSSG reproducibility workshop, Valentina and Meg will present some core
questions and techniques to facilitate project hand-offs and support "reproducible" work in a social good context.  Meg and the ethnography team draw from human-centered design, communication, and social science perspectives to facilitate conceptual discussions on how to prioritize reproducibility and technical communication for more impactful work.  Valentina will introduce more applied resources for computational reproducibility, with a focus on tools and strategies for working reproducibly in python.

## Tableau Basics
### Orysya Stus
- Tableau is a software which produces interactive visualization products. We will be going through a Tableau workflow which includes, but is not limited to, examining data, creating a data connection with Tableau, creating a couple of simple visualizations (ie. bar charts, geospatial analysis, etc.), developing a dashboard, and publishing the developed dashboard to Tableau public. The tutorial will use the following work as a sample:

## Python Integration with Tableau
### Orysya Stus
- Recent upgrades to Tableau have allowed the user to both import Python function
into Tableau and perform in-line Python scripting in Tableau. Building off our previous
work from 7/5, we will use Jupyter notebook to analyze a dataset, perform some
machine learning algorithms using `scikit-learn`, and deploy the preferred algorithm into Tableau. We will access our deployed machine learning algorithm in Tableau and use the predictive model within a dashboard. The tutorial will use the following work as a sample:
